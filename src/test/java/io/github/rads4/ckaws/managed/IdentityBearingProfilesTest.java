 * principal, which is the worst outcome this plugin can produce:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>SSO</b> — botocore's assume-role provider outranks the SSO provider, so the profile would
 *       authenticate as the agent's instance role in the wrong account. It succeeds; it is just no
 *       longer the identity the pipeline asked for.
 *   <li><b>{@code source_profile}</b> — botocore rejects a profile carrying both {@code source_profile}
 *       and {@code credential_source} outright, so every call using it fails.
 *   <li><b>{@code credential_process}, static keys, web identity</b> — the configured identity is
 *       replaced by the node role.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>None is caught by the duplicate-key guard, because the keys differ from the ones being written.

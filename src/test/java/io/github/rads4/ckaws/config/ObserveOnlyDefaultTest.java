/**
 * The shipped default pair: master switch off, observe-only on.
 *
 * <p>These two defaults are the whole safety story of an install. A fresh controller does nothing at
 * all, because the master switch gates everything; and the first time an administrator turns that
 * switch on, the safe mode is already selected, so the action reports what would happen instead of
 * changing the environment of every in-scope build at once.
 *
 * <p>Pinned in a test because a default is exactly the kind of thing that gets flipped by accident —
 * and because the pair only makes sense together. Turning {@code observeOnly} off by default would
 * silently convert the first click of the master switch into an estate-wide change.

 * independent of both Jenkins and the AWS transport: it can be unit-tested with a hand-written fake,
 * and the real implementation (planned to shell out to {@code aws sts assume-role} through the generic
 * executor in a later milestone, consistent with the project's CLI-first, no-SDK direction) can be
 * dropped in behind this interface without touching the core.

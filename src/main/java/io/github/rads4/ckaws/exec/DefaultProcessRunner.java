/**
 * {@link ProcessRunner} backed by {@link ProcessBuilder}.
 *
 * <p>The child process inherits this JVM's environment, so ambient AWS configuration (e.g.
 * {@code AWS_PROFILE}, {@code AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}, or an instance-metadata role) is available to the
 * command without this class reading any AWS config files itself.
 *
 * <p>{@link #run(List, Map)} additionally applies per-invocation environment overrides on top of that
 * inherited environment. Environment — not the argument list — is the correct channel for anything
 * sensitive: a process's arguments are world-readable via {@code ps} and {@code /proc/<pid>/cmdline},
 * while its environment is not. Like the rest of this class, the override map is completely generic; it
 * carries opaque name/value pairs and this class never inspects them.
 *
 * <p>stdout and stderr are captured <em>separately</em> and drained concurrently (stderr on a helper
 * thread) so a process that writes a lot to one stream cannot deadlock by filling a pipe buffer while
 * we block reading the other. Both captures are capped, the child gets no stdin, and the wait is
 * bounded — this runner executes in the CONTROLLER JVM, so a wedged or runaway child is a
 * controller-wide problem rather than a build-local one.

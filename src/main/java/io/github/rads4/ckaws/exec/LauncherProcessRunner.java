/**
 * {@link ProcessRunner} backed by a Jenkins {@link Launcher}, so the process runs <em>on the agent</em>
 * that the enclosing {@code node} block selected — not on the Jenkins controller.
 *
 * <p>This is the difference between authenticating as the right identity and the wrong one. The base
 * identity an AssumeRole chains from (typically an EC2 instance role) belongs to the machine the
 * command runs on, and the credentials it produces are only useful to later steps running on that same
 * machine. Controller-side execution would use the controller's identity — broader than an agent's, and
 * in most topologies not trusted by the target role at all — and would then leave the credentials on
 * the wrong host.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link DefaultProcessRunner}, this class is completely generic: it executes whatever argument
 * list it is given and never inspects it. Environment overrides are opaque name/value pairs.
 *
 * <p>stdout and stderr are captured separately into memory. The {@link Launcher} API drains both
 * streams itself, so unlike the {@link ProcessBuilder} path there is no pipe-buffer deadlock to avoid
 * here. Output is decoded as UTF-8, matching {@link DefaultProcessRunner}.
 *
 * <p>{@code quiet(true)} is set deliberately: without it the launcher echoes the command line into the
 * build log, and this runner's whole purpose is running a command whose arguments and output are
 * sensitive. There is intentionally no timeout in this milestone.

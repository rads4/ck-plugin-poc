/**
 * Managed Authentication: the plugin decorates the authentication a build was already going to use.
 *
 * <p>Jenkins consults a {@link DynamicContext} whenever a step needs a context value it has not been
 * given, and step environment is computed through {@link EnvironmentExpander}. Contributing one here
 * therefore reaches <em>every</em> step of every Pipeline — shared libraries, {@code parallel}
 * branches, {@code retry} attempts, second {@code node} blocks on other agents — with nothing to add to
 * a Jenkinsfile and nothing for anyone to remember.
 *
 * <p><b>What it does.</b> It reads the executing node's own AWS configuration, copies it into the
 * build's private temporary directory with {@code role_session_name = jk-<job>-<build>} added to
 * profiles that assume a role, and points {@code AWS_CONFIG_FILE} at the copy. Role ARNs, base
 * identities, chained profiles and regions are the node's; the plugin contributes a label and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * <p><b>What it deliberately does not do.</b> It does not set
 * {@code AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE} — measured: pointing that at a plugin-owned file breaks any
 * profile that chains through {@code source_profile} to a credentials-file profile, with
 * <em>"The source_profile … does not exist"</em>. It exports no credentials. It never authenticates on
 * the build's behalf.
 *
 * <p><b>Fail-safe is the governing property.</b> Missing configuration, an unreadable file, no
 * {@code HOME}, a workspace that cannot be written, an unexpected exception — every one of them
 * results in contributing nothing, and the build authenticates exactly as it does today. Losing
 * attribution is acceptable; failing a deployment is not.
 *
 * <p><b>The hot path does no I/O.</b> Jenkins recomputes dynamic context on every query and never
 * caches the result, so everything after the first step of a {@code node} block is a map lookup.

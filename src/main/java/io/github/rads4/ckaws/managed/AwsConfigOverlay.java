/**
 * Produces the build's AWS configuration by <b>decorating</b> the executing node's own configuration,
 * never by replacing it.
 *
 * <p>The plugin is not an authentication provider. Whatever the node's configuration already says —
 * which role, which base identity, which region, which chained profile — is left exactly as it is. The
 * single thing added is {@code role_session_name}, and only on profiles that assume a role and do not
 * already pin one. That is the only difference a build can observe, and the only difference intended.
 *
 * <p><b>Line-based, deliberately.</b> Parsing an INI and regenerating it silently drops comments,
 * reorders keys, and mangles sections the parser does not model — {@code [sso-session …]},
 * {@code [services …]}, nested sub-sections, and whatever AWS adds next. Here everything is copied
 * verbatim and the transform only ever <em>inserts</em> lines, so a diff between input and output
 * contains additions and nothing else. The tests assert exactly that.
 *
 * <p><b>Two rules that exist because breaking them would break builds.</b>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A profile that already carries {@code role_session_name} is left untouched: an administrator
 *       pinned it deliberately, and overriding a deliberate decision is worse than losing attribution.
 *   <li>Jenkins-configured profiles are <em>appended only when the node does not define them</em>. The
 *       node is the source of truth; Jenkins is the fallback for what the node does not know about.

     *   <li><b>{@code source_profile}</b> — botocore raises {@code InvalidConfigError} for a profile
     *       carrying both {@code source_profile} and {@code credential_source}, so every call using it
     *       fails outright.

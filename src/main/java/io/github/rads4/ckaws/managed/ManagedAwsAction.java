/**
 * Records where Managed Authentication wrote a build's decorated configuration, so it can be removed
 * when the build finishes.
 *
 * <p>Persisted with the build rather than held in memory, so cleanup still happens if the controller
 * restarts mid-build. Invisible because it is bookkeeping, not something a user should see.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here is sensitive: these are directory paths, and the file at them contains no credential
 * material — only the node's own configuration plus a session name.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a nested type rather than a delimited string.</b> An earlier version packed
 * {@code node + separator + path} into one string, which meant choosing a character that can appear in
 * neither. The first choice was {@code NUL}, and Jenkins persists actions as XML, where {@code 0x00} is
 * not a legal character at all — every build logged a serialization failure and no cleanup location
 * survived. Modelling the pair removes the question instead of answering it more carefully.

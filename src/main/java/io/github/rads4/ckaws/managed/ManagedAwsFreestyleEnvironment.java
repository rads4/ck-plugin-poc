/**
 * Managed Authentication for Freestyle builds.
 *
 * <p>{@link ManagedAwsContext} reaches every Pipeline build, but Pipeline's step machinery is the only
 * thing it hooks; a Freestyle build never passes through it. On a controller where Freestyle jobs upload
 * to S3 and back up Route 53, that is a hole in the audit rather than a limitation worth documenting.
 *
 * <p><b>Why an {@link EnvironmentContributor} and not {@code RunListener#setUpEnvironment}.</b> The
 * listener hook looks like the natural seam and is not: it runs <em>before</em> the workspace lease is
 * acquired, so {@code build.getWorkspace()} is still {@code null} and there is nowhere to write the
 * generated file. Measured, not assumed — the first implementation used it and contributed nothing. An
 * environment contributor runs when a build computes its environment, by which time the workspace
 * exists.
 *
 * <p><b>Freestyle only.</b> This contributor fires for every kind of build, including Pipeline, so it
 * deliberately handles {@link AbstractBuild} alone and leaves Pipeline to {@link ManagedAwsContext}.
 * Both would otherwise prepare the same build twice.
 *
 * <p><b>Everything that matters is shared.</b> This class decides <em>whether</em> to contribute and
 * where the workspace and node come from; the decoration, the safety check, the file, the memoization
 * and the cleanup record are {@link ManagedAwsContext#prepareOnce}. Two implementations of one
 * behaviour would drift, and the one that drifted would be the one nobody tested.
 *
 * <p><b>Fail-safe, identically.</b> The whole path runs inside the same guard, which swallows
 * {@link Throwable} and re-throws only {@link InterruptedException}. Anything unexpected contributes
 * nothing and the build authenticates exactly as it does without the plugin: a Freestyle job that works
 * today cannot be broken by this class.

/**
 * Removes what Managed Authentication generated, and forgets the build.
 *
 * <p>{@code onFinalized} fires for every terminal state — including {@code ABORTED}, which is the case
 * a post-build step would miss.
 *
 * <p>Deletion is <b>best effort by design</b>. The generated files hold a role ARN, a session name and
 * a shell script; the only credential material involved is the session cache the helper writes, which
 * lives in the same directory and goes with it. Nothing here is a security control, so an agent that
 * happens to be offline at finalize costs a kilobyte, not an exposure — and because the generated
 * directory has a stable path that every build overwrites, a missed cleanup is reclaimed by the next
 * build in that workspace rather than accumulating. That is why this plugin needs no sweeper thread,
 * no scheduled task and no orphan-collection service.
